Given an ID, show a report of the ID’s Google Scholar profile

We intend to create a drop-down menu on the JabRef interface. This drop-down will contain
two entries, one for each new functionality.
After selecting this entry on the menu, the user will be prompted to insert a Google Scholar
ID. Succeeding the user input, the program will access an external API that will return a
JSON file, that may contain all the information available in the Google Scholar ID’s profile.
Then, the app will internally parse the data and present it to the user.
A possible User Story could be: as a JabRef user, I want to be able to analyse the provided
Google Scholar profile so I can better judge if this profile has suitable information for my
own article.
